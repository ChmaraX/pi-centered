ALPHA paragraph. A notification starts when the API receives a trigger request with a workflow id, a subscriber id and a payload. The pipeline validates the payload, loads the subscriber and resolves which steps run.

```mermaid

  A[Request received] --> B[Validate payload] --> C[Load subscriber] --> D[Resolve workflow] --> E[Render templates] --> F[Send to provider] --> G[Record delivery]
```

BRAVO paragraph. Each channel step renders its templates with the payload and subscriber data, hands the result to a provider, and records the outcome so you can trace a missing notification back to the stage where it stopped.

  S[SmallStart] --> T[SmallEnd]

- LIST item with a nested wide diagram that Pi leaves as source:

CHARLIE paragraph. This closing paragraph comes after every diagram and example block, and it must wrap back inside the centered column exactly like the ALPHA and BRAVO paragraphs above it.
